# Celeberity-Detector
In this project I have created a web application that is used to detect the faces of 5 celebraties Ben afflek, Elton john,
Jerry seinfeld, Madonna and Mindy kaling you just need to upload a file and then the cnn with a densenet model will give 
the name of the celebrity he thinks is the most likely.
It is build by using than deployed using heroku
