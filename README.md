# Celeberity-Detector
In this project I have used pytorch to create a CNN modeland used Densenet to do transfer learninng that is used to detect the faces of 5 celebraties Ben afflek, Elton john, Jerry seinfeld, Madonna and Mindy kaling and than created a web application. In the web application you just need to upload a image and then the CNN network will predict the image and display the name of the celebrity it thinks is the most likely.
It is deployed using heroku
